My tenure at IBM Research Australia lasted from July to December 2016. I was
taken on as an intern for the Infrastructure, Services, and Technologies team
for the IBM Research Lab in Carlton. Throughout my time in this time, I worked
on a range of different projects, as well as learned quite a bit about the work
being performed at the lab. One of my very first projects was to assist the team
in migrating their repositories from one version control platform (gitlab) to
another (github). In doing so, I learned about version control using git as well
as to handle dependencies within code, as some parts of the repositories had to
be altered to make them compatible with the new version control platform. I also
attempted to assist another team, specifically the retinal imaging team, in one
of their projects â€“ to clean up their collection of stereoscopic retinal images
by removing dust from the camera. However, this project turned out to be very
time consuming and I was forced to abandon it in favour of my responsibilities
within my team.
